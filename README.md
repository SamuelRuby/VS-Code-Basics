***Why Python? 

It's a very popular way to writing computer programs and automations with board applications: SpaceX & NASA use it to launch rockets, Tesla with autonomous driving, Instagram as a web app backend, Intel to pilot drones/UAVs, and many many others.

What you can do with Python is nearly endless:

- Run powerful web applications

- Fly drones and launch rockets

- Run autonomous robots like drones and self-driving cars

- Build connected systems with Arduino and Raspberry PI

- Automate business intelligences and perform financial analysis

-Machine learning including deep learning

-And many more ways


Python is just a tool for writing a series of step-by-step automation rules and that's exactly what software is: a collection of rules for a computer to follow.

The right tools in the right hands can impact the world in such amazing ways.
